Python resources
----------------

* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
  * Ned Batchelder's talk "Pragmatic Unicode, or, How Do I Stop The Pain?"
* https://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/
  * includes an introduction to Python coding for mathematical purposes
* Python for Data Analysis, Wes McKinney (created pandas module)
  * Additional materials for book: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
* [Project Euler Playground](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab/tree/Documents/JupyterLab/Project%20Euler%20with%20Python.ipynb)
* [Ultimate Python Study Guide](https://github.com/huangsam/ultimate-python)
* [Amazing Python](https://www.awesome-python.com)
* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
    > This guide is opinionated in a way that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Python’s official documentation. You won’t find a list of every Python web framework available here. Rather, you’ll find a nice concise list of highly recommended options.

General-purpose coding/programming research
-------------------------------------------

* https://www.w3schools.com/
  * Excellent coding resource that I've used since middle school with a focus on server-side coding. Sometimes a little abstract/theory-heavy but a very great resource and introduction to many languages, including Python, C/C++/C#, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript. Probably not the best place to learn what is up-to-date best practice.
